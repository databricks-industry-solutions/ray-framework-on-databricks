# Deploying Ray Apps with Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs)

## Business Problem
Developers building production data processing pipelines with Ray need standardized CICD/DevOps interfaces to deploy them to one or more Databricks workspace or clusters. This is exactly what Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs) provides: an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) approach to managing your Databricks projects, including for Ray workloads.

## Reference Architecture

The examples in this repository demonstrate the following solutions:
1. **Submit Ray code to Global Ray Cluster from CLI/IDE**
    * This is a drop-in replacement to [Ray Jobs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/running-applications/job-submission/index.html), as Databricks clusters do not allow you to address the head node IP directly for security reasons.

2. **Define a multi-step DABs with Ray and non-Ray tasks**
    * Work in progress


For further documentation and customization opportunities with DABs, please see:
